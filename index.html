        <h1 class="red">BMW M3 G80</h1>
        <p><strong>The BMW M3 G80 - </strong>The BMW M3 Competition Sedan with M xDrive delivers 523 hp thanks to its high-performance 6-cylinder BMW M TwinPower Turbo gasoline engine. Just as impressive, the powerful 503 hp BMW M3 Competition Sedan with rear-wheel drive. Both vehicles deliver the ultimate driving dynamics - both on the racetrack and everyday roads.</p>

        <h1 class="white">Mercedes CLS 63 AMG</h1>
        <p><strong>The CLS 63 - </strong>Whenever you add the letters “AMG” to a Mercedes model, you are sure to get breathtaking performance, and the CLS63 AMG is no exception. As the high-horsepower version of Mercedes’ “four-door coupe,” it offers stylish lines with room for four. Under the hood is a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V-8 that makes a beastly 577 hp and 590 lb-ft with a seven-speed automatic. All-wheel drive (4Matic) is standard, as is an adaptive sport suspension.</p>

        <h1 class="purple">Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</h1>
        <p><strong>The Dodge Demon - </strong>Dodge has created many super-powerful Challengers  over the muscle car's long production run, but none so formidable as the Demon 170. Packing a modified version of the Hellcat V-8, the Demon 170 makes enormous power and is purpose-built for drag racing. The 170 in its name indicates the alcohol proof of the E85 ethanol fuel it runs on. Consider it a swansong for the Challenger as this generation prepares to meet its end.</p>
